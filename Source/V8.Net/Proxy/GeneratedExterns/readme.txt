DO NOT edit 'ProxyLoader.x86_DllImports.cs'.  Instead, edit 'ProxyLoader.cs', then right-click on 'Generate32BitExterns.tt' to run it.

'Generate32BitExterns.tt' will generate the x86 import mappings automatically from the 64-bit ones.

Note: The text template file is NOT included in the .Net Full project.  Only run it within the .Net Standard project; the .Net Full project will pick up automatically.
